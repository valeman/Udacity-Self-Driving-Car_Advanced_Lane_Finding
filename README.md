# Udacity-Self-Driving-Car_Advanced_Lane_Finding
Lane finding is important component of self-driving cars, the lane finding algorithms should be robust to change in road types, lightining and weather conditions and curvature of the road. In this project we build algorithm to identify left and right lanes based on the images from dash-mounted camera video. The algorithm uses advanced computer vision techniques to detect lanes, locate the car between two lanes and estimate curvature of the road.
